    "We call ourselves *Homo sapiens* --man the wise-- because our intelligence is so important for us. For thousands of years, we have tried to understand how we think; that is, how a mere handful of matter can perceive, understand, predict and manipulate a world far larger and more complicated than itself. The field of artificial intelligence or AI, goes further still: it attempts not just to understand but also to build intelligent entities."

  \note{in Hindu mythology the Vishwakarma, the god of craftsmanship and the architect of gods, and the sorceress Maya had created automation along with many architectural wonders. Vishwakarma (meaning: world creator) is also regarded as the creator of the Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
  
  Furthemore, Indian Lokapannatti (collection of cycles and lores from 11 century AD), tells the story of how an army of automated soldiers (bhuta vahana yanta) were crafted to protect the relics of Buddha in a secret stupa.
  in the time of kings Ajatasatru and Asoka. Ajatasatru, who reigned from 492 to 460 B.C., was recognized for commissioning new military inventions, such as powerful catapults and a mechanized war chariot with whirling blades. 
  When Buddha died, Ajatasatru was entrusted with defending his precious remains. The king hid them in an underground chamber near his capital, Pataliputta (now Patna) in northeastern India.
  Traditionally, statues of giant warriors stood on guard near treasures. But in the legend, Ajatasatru's guards were extraordinary: They were robots. In India,
  automatons or mechanical beings that could move on their own were called "bhuta vahana yanta," or "spirit movement machines" in Pali and Sanskrit. According
  to the story, it was foretold that Ajatasatru's robots would remain on duty until a future king would distribute Buddha's relics throughout the realm.

  Two centuries after Ajatasatru, Asoka ruled the powerful Mauryan Empire in
  Pataliputta, 273-232 B.C\@. Asoka constructed many stupas to enshrine Buddha's
  relics across his vast kingdom. According to the legend, Asoka had heard the
  legend of the hidden relics and searched until he discovered the underground
  chamber guarded by the fierce android warriors. Violent battles raged between
  Asoka and the robots.

      \item In 1932 Sir Charles Sherrington and Edgar Adrian won the Nobel Prize for proposing the concept of synapses (junctions between neurons, pictured), which advanced the understanding of the central nervous system;

  Book: Common Sesnse , the turing test and the quest for real AI.

  Winograd schema questions simply require the resolution of anaphora: the machine must identify the antecedent of an ambiguous pronoun

  Ask a pointed multiple choice question that requires knowledge of the subject matter.
  
  For eg: Context where "give" can appear are statistically quite similar to those where "receive" can appear, and yet the answer must change depending on which one is used.
  This helps make the test google-proof: having access to a large corpus of English test would likely not help.
  The claim is that doing better than guessing requires subject to figure out what is going on.

  \note{Are Pocket Calculators Agents? Yes, Key state are sensors, Digit display is actuator, it does some processing from the sensors to give output
  
  However AI is more interested in agents with large computational resources and environments that require nontrivial decision making.
  
  Usually Program are persistent, autonomous, proactive and goal directed.

  Rational Agents aren't omniscient (doesn't know everything), aren't clairvoyant (cannot perceive events in the future or beyond what's visible), but they can explore the environment and learn autonomously.

    \item \textbf{Accessible}: Fully Observable vs Partially Observable: requires memory (internal state)
    \item Single-agent or Multiagent: compete or coordinate with other agents
    \item \textbf{Deterministic} or \textbf{Stochastic}: need to handle Uncertainty and contingencies
    \item Static or Dynamic: compute a rational decision (static)
    \item Discrete or Continuous : controller to be operated continuously or in discrete steps
    \item Known/unknown physics : need for exploration
    \item Known/unknown perf. measure: observe/interact with human supervisor
    \item Sequential or Episodic (current action will not effect future action):

    It seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. … At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control - Alan Turing
  \end{quote}
  
\note{Turings point: how do we retain control of an entity smarter than human?

EG: Optimizing Clickthrough in Social media, start with learning what people want but can endup modifying people to be more predictable

Humans are intelligent to the extent that our actions can be expected to achive our objectives

Machines are beneficial to the extent that their cation can be expected to achieve our objectives (not their objectives)

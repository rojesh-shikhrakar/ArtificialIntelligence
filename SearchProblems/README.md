# Search Problems

Definition of a Problem: Problem as a state space representation, Problem formulation,
Well-deflned problems,Constraint satislaction problem. Water jug problem,N-queen problem. Cryptarithmetic problem. Graph coloring problem
2.2 Problem solving by searching, types o1' scarching. MeasLrring problem solving performance, General State Space Search
2.3 Uninformed:Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search,Depth-Limited Search, Iterative Deepening depth first Search, Bidirectional Search" Using uninformed search techniques for solving N-Queens Problem, puzzle problem etc.
2.4 Infpormed search:Greedy Best-First Search.A*Search, Optimality, of A*, Local search: Hill Climbing. Simulated Annealing, using informed search techniques for solving N-Queens Problem, Puzzle problem etc
